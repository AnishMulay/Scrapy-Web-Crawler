 In short its a game go with some nicely layeredin barbs about the state of race relations and theres a mound of Oscar gold to be found among the impressive mostly AfricanAmerican cast ,259

 Black Panther goes leaps and bounds above what was expected The reason is not only because it is the best Marvel solo movie It is deeper than that ,264
 And when it comes to the two leads Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Michael B Jordan as Erik Killmonger represent the most complex and fascinating heroadversary dynamic shown in a superhero film in years ,265

 Black Panther delivers on most every level ,268

 Expect to leave the theatre more exhausted than entertained ,270
 Hype cultural importance and expectation aside Black Panther is an excellent comic book movie Perhaps one of the best Ive ever seen ,271
 The real stars of Black Panther are its women both before and behind the camera ,272
 Black Power indeedpresents some great role models for an underserved audience while promoting an antinationalistic message and thats no small thing ,273
 More impressive with a couple of minor exceptions the storyline navigates expectations that it would carry themes of racial politics into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with grace and goodwill ,274
 Ultimately its more interesting to think about than it is to watch ,275
 This movie is not going to let you forget your time in Wakanda ,276
 Masterful Marvel film has depth diversity and violence ,277
 Much as he did with Creed Coogler has once again transcended the form and made a whole other kind of great movie ,278

 A ripping action flick on which a great deal of care has been expended ,284
 Coogler breathes life into it with a visual and emotional flair that feels like actual substance rather than pomp and circumstance ,285
 Black Panther is a solid MCU movie entertaining if somewhat disposable If you like the rest of these movies youll probably like this one too ,286
 Black Panther boasts a sense of grandeur as it tells a sprawling Shakespearean tale that traverses the political racial ideological familial and fantastical ,287
 I had hoped for so much more than what was delivered The loyal fan base will no doubt think otherwise ,288
 They will write about this movie and make videos about it it will be discussed among friends of all ages all races all shapes and sizes it will be taught in school debated among intellectuals it will be seen as the moment everything changed ,289
 theres so much more to Black Panther than a shrewd movie studio finally recognizing the value of an untapped market ,290
 Wildly enjoyable ,291
 Most of the time Black Panther delivers a masterful new take on the superhero origin story fresh in its perspective and energetic in its plotting I highly recommend ,292
 Black Panthers important and timely but more than that its a hugely entertaining film ,293
 A powerful new Marvel superhero arrives in an exciting exhilarating socially relevant Afrofuturist origin story ,294
 Black Panthers failures like its triumphs are more Shakespearean than superheroic ,295
 In the end Black Panther is basically a really satisfying thrill ride ,296
 Its uniquely satisfying popcorn entertainment a triumphant trifecta of subject matter talent and timing ,297
 its not just powerful because its awesome and its not just awesome because its powerful ,298
 a solid and entertaining film that arrives at the right place at the right time Full Review in Spanish ,299
 Not since Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight Rises has a superhero film so openly expressed politics not so much ideology but a cultural mood and taken so many chances ,300
 Full of nobility and purpose without sacrificing fun and charm A slambang action adventure that also fills a need ,301
 Its impossible to picture anyone other than Boseman in the lead role but by god Michel B Jordan certainly gives him a run for his money ,302
 Its an excellent proud movie and it has a lot to be proud of ,303
 While Black Panther is undeniably exciting overall its opening sequences are more convoluted than most MCU films But from there theres a lot of compelling exciting crowdpleasing action ,304
 Black Panther is an important movie that doesnt feel like being forced to eat kale thanks to car chases shootouts and subtle bursts of humor ,305
 I dont know nor care if this is Marvels best but it certainly is the most thoughtful and conscientious look that the studio has given to true life injustices Full Review in Spanish ,306
 Inhabits a nuanced moral universe with compelling villains and uses the fantastic to grapple with real ideas I cant believe this is a Marvel movie ,307
 This is one helping of popular culture in which effects dont dominate every scene and characters have room to breathe Thats good news for Marvel and even better news for those in the audience ,308
 Black Panther gives the eponymous hero a whole epic to himself and the complicated story of his longhidden homeland with some pseudoShakespearean power struggles ,309
 Hail Wakanda Powerful symbolism and visuals fabulous supporting cast score produced by Kendrick Lamar Film is also technical embarrassment of riches ,310
 As a writerdirector Coogler has firmly established that his strength is in creating and developing intimate relationships that capture the viewers attention ,311
 Lupita Nyongo and Danai Gurira who play Nakia and Okoye respectively are particularly fierce especially in their numerous fight scenes a rarity for women in a superhero movie outside of Wonder Woman ,312
 Coogler has played with the age of dilemma of winning freedom through armed struggle versus gaining it through peaceful means But Black Panther is no Gandhi hes a superhero with enhanced abilities and a combat suit that James Bond would kill for ,313
 The continent that gave birth to humanity wont look the same on the big screen ever again thanks to the introduction of Wakanda the fictional home of the most technologically advanced people on the planet ,314
 Coogler and his talented cast and team tell a story that dazzles one that dares its audience to dream of a world unrestrained by our own stifling reality without ignoring how the pain of the real world informs those joyful dreams ,315
 This film is a giant middle finger to all things authoritarian ,316
 Black Panther could have been just another Marvel rompa fun but ultimately disposable entry in the studios catalogue But Ryan Coogler and company had the power and perhaps the responsibility to do much more And they did ,317
 Classic comicbook stuff made fresh by drawing on underexplored mythologies and cultures yet still deeply resonant and deeply universal An exhilarating pulpfiction dream that ups the ante on the Marvel Cinematic Universe ,318
 The wildly enjoyable Black Panther claws its way to the top of the Marvel Universe ,319
 You can feel the sameness of Black Panther Watching the film though is to see something completely different in the realm of these stories ,320
 The film per se is correct but it is not the masterpiece of action cinema that will mark paragons nor set the bar higher Full review in Spanish ,321
 the freeest film in the MCU Full Review in Spanish ,322
 Black Panther is a superhero film that manages to achieve moments of cinematic clarity that all great films do It is worth your time and it will spark your imagination ,323
 But the most revolutionary thing about Black Panther is its city The capital of Wakanda has skyscrapers a monorail sidewalks of grass green buildings farmers markets and no cars ,324
 One of the years best films and one that transcends the superhero genre to emerge as an epic of operatic proportions ,325
 Believe the hype Black Panther transcends its comicbook origins achieving a mythic grandeur thats nothing short of exhilarating ,326
 It is a landmark moment in blockbuster cinema that couldnt be more timely or more confident in its ability to be so ,327
 The script adheres to the usual genre formula of tomfoolery injokes mythology and outright poppycock but their knack for teasing emotional resonance out of standard scenarios gives them the edge over predecessors and competitors alike ,328
 Destined to be celebrated and for good reason this may not be the first film featuring a black superhero but it is groundbreaking all the same for being the first of this scale ,329
 Its more than just an overdue step of onscreen representation Its also a rollicking good blockbuster even if it doesnt quite reinvent the wheel ,330
 Black Panther is so worth the hype ,331
 A beautiful hallucinatory sequence as Killmonger reaches peak villain and assumes his powers is the most dramatically fraught and heartwrenching moment in any Marvel movie ,332
 A fresh new Marvel superhero movie unlike any other ,333
 Black Panther is a pretty entertaining film and an important one even though it stops short of being a great one ,334
 Chadwick Boseman carries that moral and emotional weight to reaffirm him as one of Marvels finest casting choices ,335
 Like TChallas step toward becoming a world leader Black Panther shows the next generation of comic book films how its done ,336
 The richness of the visual palette here is dazzling ,337
 Will play well across the board and thankfully features more depth than your typical superhero movie fare Full Content Review for Parents Violence Profanity etc also Available ,338
 This is serious superhero business That gravity is the movies strength and weakness ,339
 Yes this Black Panther is redhot Wakanda forever ,340
 Forget a lethal presidential Twitter account King TChalla has drank some kind of tea made from a HeartShaped Herb enabling him to take on an army Black Panther pulls the right emotional levers focusing on the theme of the forgotten and the lost ,341
 Black Panther is a feast for the eyes the ears the heart and the mind a film that has action heart substance and soul ,342
 In the red white and blue hueniverse of superhero colors black is the new beautiful ,343
 An insipid soulless and overproduced bore ,344
 Like the best blockbusters its flawed but ridiculously entertaining anyway and like too few of them its also so incredibly important ,345
 Michael B Jordan gives a hell of a performance Maybe people will stop blaming him for FF and give him his due Killmonger is one of the best characters Marvel has ever created Stop using the Race card to promote this film ,346
 Thats the sound of the game being changed and everyone is going to have to follow the King This should signal a major change to the superhero film landscape for years ,347
 A wonderful sense of culture and costumed authority creating a vibrant solo showcase for the world of Wakanda and all the political turbulence and fierceness it contains ,348
 The good definitely outweighs the problematic here making for a superhero movie thats definitely one of the better examples of the genre though hardly as groundbreaking as some would claim ,349
 Black Panther is a great MCU superhero adventure that smoothly blends rich narrative substance with sheer popcorn entertainment ,350
 This is an origin story globetrotting spy thriller and fantasy all in one The movie manages to be part of but something completely different than the Marvel superhero movies that came before ,351
 Black Panther is without a doubt the coolest superhero movie to come prowling out of Marvel Studios ,352
 All hail Ryan Coogler the Black Panther the Dora Milaje and everyone who helped to bring this nextlevel majestic and wildly entertaining superhero movie to life ,353
 Whats honestly amazing about this film is that Im not thinking about the action the cool epic momentsIm thinking about the things that shape these characters into who they becomeI have to commend Black Panther but its not a film without flaws ,354
 Black Panther was fantastic It has the fun superhero stuff but thats not really what its aboutthey bring you in on a fascinating colorful vibrant civilization ,355
 With a bloated hour minute running time Coogler ran out of ideas ,356
 while Nyongo and Wright get the most playfully lively opportunities to charm it is the fiercely dedicated passion Gurira brings to her portrayal of the warrior Okoye that impressed me the most ,357
 If Wakanda invisible to the naked eye yet brimming with futuristic technology that could better the entire planet is a beautifully depicted metaphor for representation then Killmonger is a manifestation of AfricanAmerican pain past and present ,358
 Black Panther proves how representation can rejuvenate even the oldest superhero origin arcs allowing Marvel a victory that still feels every bit a Ryan Coogler film ,359
 Theres talent in every corner of the film and it elevates Black Panther beyond so many of its superhero contemporaries even as it exhibits some formulaic tendencies ,360
 A vibrant film that beautifully blends superhero action with a poignant Shakespeareaninscope story ,361
 All of these conflicts are eventually resolved in the conventional framework of a Marvel action movie More unconventional are Cooglers ideas ,362
 It is a terrifically entertaining film alive from the start following its Marvel mission for good and bad while rising above it ,363
 This is s first great motion picture a title that will surely be remembered when end of the year bests are discussed ,364
 Iron Man tries too hard and Captain America is far too earnest to be cool but Black Panther both Chadwick Bosemans portrayal of the character and the film that surrounds him is just effortlessly cool ,365
 In Black Panther Coogler and company have made a superhero picture thats twice as good twice as smart twice as fun to look at as any before it May they get twice the credit and twice the box office ,366
 Thats some complex stuff for a superhero movie and Coogler and coscreenwriter Joe Robert Cole give it the emotional weight it deserves ,367
 The results are astonishing ,368
 Between Black Panthers Black Lives Matter subtext and its use of female characters as more than window dressing both in front of and behind the camera it seems as though Hollywood has for one shining moment caught up with the real world ,369
 Smart accessible and thoroughly fun Black Panther is a new high for Marvel Studios ,370
 Black Panther is one of the best superhero movies of the century ,371
 Black Panther is the superhero movie no movie no qualifier necessary that we need right here right now ,372
 Ryan Cooglers overall ambition in crafting a sociologically complex story and presenting it as standard comic book movie fare succeeds There is nothing common about Black Panther ,373
 Chadwick Boseman is perfect as the Panther just the right mixture of royal privilege and humility in a story that allows for a sense of wonder rarely found in comic book movies ,374
 To the infinite credit of Coogler and his team Black Panther fights constantly and bitterly against the familiar constraints of Disneys superhero industrial complex ,375
 Its very very good in its best scenes exhilarating ,376
 The bad guy is so brilliantly realized by Cooglers frequent collaborator Michael B Jordan as Erik Killmonger Stevens a former Navy SEAL gone bad ,377
 It is modern sharp and cool honoring the past as well as the present and pushing the boundaries of the genre past what audiences are used to from superhero movies ,378
 a cinematically holistic work of diversity in which cultural identity has been carefully woven into every element of the movie ,379
 Letitia Wright steals the thunder as TChallas younger sister and Wakandas tech and weapons genius I would love to see her and Tony Stark in the same room just to watch them outgeeking each other ,380
 Its possible to love Black Panther but be conflicted but still love it but still be conflicted all the while sharing in the unmitigated joy of its existence ,381
 Black is beautiful ,382
 Black Panther a gleaming example of Afrofuturism provides a unique perspective on a wellworn genre ,383
 These are no small ideas This cogent screenplay serves up the obligatory superhero trappings but it addresses realworld issues of global propriety and responsibility with an underlying sense of gravity ,384
 Black Panther might be the first MCU film that could claim to most clearly be an expression of a particular directors voice ,385
 Boilerplate Marvel with a sleek colorful look cheeky humor and familiar action beatsBut Coogler brings enough to the table for a fresh vision broadly appealing as well as inspirational in its representation for black audiences and women ,386
 One of the best films from Marvel thanks to its richness in culture and mythology and one of the best villains to date Michael B Jordan is fantastic Full review in Spanish ,387
 Black Panther is worthy no question but its also a little dull ,388
 The plotting is predictable and the action sequences for the most part unengaging Black Panther is a major disappointment ,389
 May Marvel learn its lesson from Black Panther When a movie like this ends up feeling both personal and vital youve done something right ,390
 Chadwick Boseman commands every moment of this film radiating probity and purpose and its only later on that you realize that with another actor this wouldnt have been a sure thing ,391
 Its taken a decade and films but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has finally produced a superhero movie that feels like it was ripped from the pages of a comic book ,392
 Coogler is a young filmmaker this is just his third feature following Fruitvale Station and Creed two fine and very different films but he marshals this world with confidence and flair ,393
 Like all the best comics movies this ones got a villain Michael B Jordan so compelling he nearly steals the show from the hero Chadwick Boseman ,394
 Noble and worthwhile but slow and frankly generic save for the terrific African touches ,395
 Marvel Studios has yet again managed to blend together familiar elements into something that feels new with Black Panther ,396
 Marvels Black Panther is a complete triumph and is simply one of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe entries yet ,397
 Whilst a Marvel story through and through fitting perfectly into the MCU postCaptain America Civil War Black Panther stands alone as a masterpiece of filmmaking ,398
 Theres a whole lot going on in this latest Marvel chapter And boy are we all the better for it ,399
 a song of freedom within the genre Full Review in Spanish ,400
